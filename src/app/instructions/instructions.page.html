        The concept behind Word License is fairly simple. You are given a license plate 
        with three letters and three numbers. The numbers are there to just to complete 
        the image of a license plate. What you need to pay attention to are the letters.

        The goal for each set of three letters is to find a word in the dictionary that 
        contains those three letters in the given order. The letters do not have to appear 
        in the word consecutively.

        For example, given the letters 'LEC', possible words include, but are not limited to
        "leach", "lecture", and "electric". Note that the word does not have to begin with the 
        first letter in the given set of three.

        The set of three-letter combinations was generated from a third-party dictionary. What 
        this means is that every set of letters correpsonds to at least one word in the dictionary. 
        Since the dictionary may contain obscure, little-known words, you may come across some 
        seemingly impossible letter combinations. Feel free to skip these ones, otherwise you 
        can consider them a challenge!
